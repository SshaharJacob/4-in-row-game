==================
Here I present the game '4 in a row'. The user has the option to play against another player or against a computer. 
The program incorporates GUI graphical interface.

For playing, the server should insert the fllowing parameters: human/ai port
The client should insert the fllowing parameters: human/ai port ip
for example, for playing player vs player, put this parameters:
first player (host): human 8000
second player: human 8000 IP
while IP can be found with this command: print(socket.gethostbyname(socket.gethostname()))
for playing against the computer, change in one of the player to 'ai' instead 'human'.


===============================
This program contains 4 files:

1. game: contains a Game class.
This class is in charge of all the changes in the board dictionary.
The functions in this class are checking the board and make changes in it when needed.

2. ai: This file contain an Ai class.
In this class there is only one function- 'find_legal_move', which checks where
the computer can put a disc on the board, and place it. 

3. four_in_a_row: contains a GUI class. This class is in charge of the
graphics of the game, and operating it as well. It changes the graphic board
accordingly to the changes in the Game object (a board dictionary).

4. communicator: auxiliary file provided by the course staff.
